# Deep Learning Toolkit
A collection of reusable tools for various deep learning tasks.


## Overview
This repository provides a general toolkit to help developers and researchers quickly address common deep learning tasks. It contains a curated set of modules and tools, with a particular focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

Since my current research is primarily in NLP, the tools in the `natural_language_processing` directory will be updated and maintained more frequently.


## Key Features
### ðŸ¤– Natural Language Processing (NLP)
This section contains practical tools for NLP tasks, especially those related to Large Language Models (LLMs).
- **llm_input**: Offers various methods to optimize input for different LLM tasks.
- **llm_output**: Focuses on processing LLM outputs, with a specialization in structured data extraction.
- **llm_labeler**: Provides multiple implementations for using LLMs to perform simple data labeling tasks.
- **zero_shot_classification**: A zero-shot classifier for quickly categorizing low-level semantic text, serving as an effective tool for initial text processing in projects.


### Other Toolkits
This section includes useful tools I've implemented in other deep learning domains.
#### ðŸŽµ Audio Processing (Audio)
- **automatic_speech_recognition**: A speech recognition tool for audio transcription.
#### ðŸ’» Computer Vision (Computer Vision)
- **object_detection**: Implements object detection in images and object tracking based on it.
- **optical_character_recognition**: An OCR tool for recognizing character content in images.
- **utils**: Contains general tools and functions for image processing.
#### ðŸŽ¨ Multimodal
- **sematic_similarity**: Provides methods for cross-modal semantic similarity comparison.
